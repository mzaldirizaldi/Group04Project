                <br>BlaBlaBla is a video gaming website that provides news, reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video games. The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady and Jon Epstein. It was purchased by ZDNet, a brand which was later purchased by CNET Networks. CBS Interactive, which purchased CNET Networks in 2008, is the current owner of BlaBlaBla.<br>

                <br>In addition to the information produced by BlaBlaBla staff, the site also allows users to write their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site's forums.<br>

                <br>In 2004, BlaBlaBla won "Best Gaming Website" as chosen by the viewers in Spike TV's second Video Game Award Show,[3] and has won Webby Awards several times. The domain blablabla.co attracted at least 60 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study.[4]<br>

            <h2>History</h2><br>
            <p>BlaBlaBla was started in October 1997 and operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site. During this period, BlaBlaBla won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical Publishers Association interactive) award for best website, and was short listed in 2001. Following the purchase of ZDNet by CNET, BlaBlaBla was merged with the main US site. On April 24, 2006, BlaBlaBla UK was relaunched.</p><br>
            <p>In a similar fashion, BlaBlaBla existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003, GameSpot.com.au content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was fully re-launched in mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local reviews, special features, local pricings in Australian dollars, Australian release dates, and more local news.</p><br>
            <p>BlaBla in its current form launched in 2007. It provides Japanese video game industry news, previews, reviews, features, and videos as well as translated articles from the other BlaBlaBla sites.</p><br>
