      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is one of the most graphically impressive titles on PS4 and Xbox One. It's also one of this generation's best action games. A year after its console debut, Rockstar Games finally brings the smash-hit to PC. After initially suffering from numerous technical issues at launch, RDR2 now (mostly) runs as intended. As with its console counterparts, RDR2 is a must-own title and arguably the finest, most authentic open-world epic released by Rockstar Games.</p><br>
            
      <p>RDR2 is a prequel to Red Dead Redemption. Like that title, RDR2 is a story about the death of the Old West. You take control of Arthur Morgan, a man who belongs to an outlaw group called the Vanderlinde Gang. Having spent most of his life in the gang, Arthur has become disillusioned by the outlaw lifestyle. Still, Arthur can't see himself doing anything other than stealing and killing.</p><br>
            
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is a graphically impressive game on consoles and the PC edition is similarly taxing. Make sure your system meets the recommended specs. The game's rendition of the Old West looks spectacular thanks to impressive draw distances, higher-quality global illumination, ambient occlusion, and higher resolutions. The newly added photo mode lets you capture RDR2's beauty.</p><br>
        
      <p>To play RDR2, you need a gaming desktop or gaming laptop that has at least an AMD FX-6300 or Intel Core i5-2500K CPU, AMD Radeon R9 280 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 GPU, 8GB of RAM, 150GB of storage, and the Windows 7 operating system (with Service Pack 1).</p><br>
    
      <p>When RDR2 first launched on PC, many people had problems running it at max settings. Even those who own the $1200 Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card couldn't get the most out of the game. Rockstar Games has since alleviated some of these issues via software updates, but even my rig, which features an Intel i7 4790 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, cannot properly run RDR2 on the Ultra setting. On my PC, RDR2 runs at a frame rate that fluctuates between 45-55 frames per second when in the open world and 50-60 frame per second indoors (at 1080p resolution). I'm not sure if this is an optimization issue or if RDR2 is the new Crysis. This is the only PC game I own that I cannot fully max out without the graphics negatively affecting gameplay.</p><br>
        
      <p>Though not without some performance issues, Red Dead Redemption 2 amazes on PC. Its incredible story, beautiful graphics, multitude of optional quests, and ever-updated online mode may keep you hooked for years. RDR2 wonderfully simulates the Old West's mythology, making it one of the best action games you'll find on PC. That said, few gamers will be able to appreciate it on max settings, and its lovingly animated characters can sometimes weigh down gameplay.</p><br>
